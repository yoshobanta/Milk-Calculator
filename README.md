# ü•õ Milk Calculator (User-Friendly Version)

A **Streamlit app** to calculate monthly milk expenses.  
I made this app **for my mom ‚ù§Ô∏è** so she can easily check how much money to give to the milkman without any confusion.

## ‚ú® Why This Version Exists
The initial version of this app **failed miserably**.  
- My mom struggled to **delete 0.0** before typing the milk quantity.  
- She didn‚Äôt understand **Liters vs Milliliters** easily.  
- Selecting the correct number of **days in a month (30, 31, 28)** was confusing.  

So, I completely **redesigned it to be mom-friendly**, focusing on simplicity and clarity.

- **Units simplified**: Milliliters and Liters clearly indicated
